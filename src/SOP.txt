Okay….This is the most important question of whole application. We human beings have a mind that need a purpose to live a life. All other’s just code by mother nature we also but something other than that code exist in us. Which seeks for betterment in every work we do. its different that the definition by all mean is differnt for differnt human being and each human being here running on a pariticular philosophy or purpose having not is a one for almost all ones.
We passed through the great revolutions whether its be Agricultural or Industrial to Technological one. Now we are on a shift moving from Software revolution to something differnt or say Post human Era. All these revolution in some sense benifits but mostly affected human lifes. We cant stop the progration we are making but it will demand some people to lead one otherwise most worst things our developement did w/t us is climate change. already five time wiped entirely may be again climate change wipe out so we have to took the direction obviously we cant say stop everthing like luddiate its not a solution.                                                                                                                                             By firming the roots in the education i will try my best to lead this one. For further post graduation like Masters in top universities demand more Research based profile. So need to grab some Research Fellowship to go further to apply these universities. That’s the purpose made to apply For the OIST. I dont want to trap in the Work-Life balance philosophy made by industrialist of Industrial Revolution. 
In this way OIST will help me to go further. Field will be mostly AI and machine learning. More research fellowships for strong research and top universities w/the independent projects will help me to lead upcoming shift. Also i will try my best to arrange some funds from my family like tickest/VISA and Emergency Funds.  I am not from a decent family so also considering my application for funding will helps a lot.
